# webAO

This is a client for the Attorney Online roleplaying chatroom written in HTML and JavaScript.
It works with the tsuserver3/serverD software when the server has WebSockets enabled.

webAO-only features:
 - Asset URLs
 - Automated testimony control

Desktop-only features:
 - 2.6+ markup
 - Non-interrupting preanimations

In short, webAO is in disrepair. Again.
